<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Hi! My name is Jason Stevens, and I am a senior at Brockton High School.</p>

<p>In my free time my favorite thing to do is play basesball, I like to do it as much as I possibly can. Whether it is games or practices it is my favorite thing to do. When i am not playing I enjoy playing video games or working out. I try to go to the gym as much as possible, but as a student it sometimes gets tough due to my large amounts of homework. I love all sports in general. Obviously my favorite teams are all of the <a href="https://www.boston.com/section/sports0">boston teams</a>, but besides them my favorite sports team is the <a href="https://www.mlb.com/athletics">Oakland Athletics</a>.</p>

## Family
I have a really big family. I live with my mom, my dad and my twin brother Matthew. The large part of my family starts with my grandmother. She has 4 kids and all of them have kids as well. She is also 1 of 18 siblings and most of them also have kids who also have kids, so i have tons of cousins, aunts and uncles.

I also have 3 cats named Nala, Teddy, Gizmo and a turtle named Tuck.
